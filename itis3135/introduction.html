                Funny Story: i was a paratrooper in the army and on one of my first jumps outside of airborne school i
                did not jump out of the plane correctly i basically tried walking out of a side door exit and the wind
                pushed me back against the plane and i rolled down the side of a C-130 before my parachute deployed<br>
                <br>
