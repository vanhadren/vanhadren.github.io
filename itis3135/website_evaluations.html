        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

        <h3><a href="https://www.feelingpeaky.com/9-principles-of-good-web-design/"> good website example</a></h3>
                <p>
                    This website is called Feeling Peaky.
                    It is a website on good website design principles.
                    This website does not directly quote the CRAP design acronim
                    but it does contain all of the elements of CRAP design.
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px"> 
                    CRAP stands for :<br>
                    Contrast<br>
                    Repitition<br>
                    Alignment<br>
                    Proximenty<br>
                    </p>
                    i will point out ways the wesite follows CRAP design.<br>
                    First, the website features a white background and grey text for the body elements
                    this follows the light / dark template suggested in crap.<br>
                    Second, out side of the title all the sections headers are the same color and font.
                    The same three colors are used throughout the website and the paragraphs are all similary formatted.
                    Third, each paragraph element is aligned the same. They all form a straight line on the left side.
                    Subsections of each section are all indented the same distace and form their own straight line.
                    Fourth, each paragragh is the same distance from the previous and next. each header is the same
                    distance
                    from its respective paragraph. Even the added graphics are the same distance from each paragraph.
                    also similar paragraph are grouped togeather and different topics are seperated by new headers
                    informing the reader
                    that they are on a new subject.
                </p>
        

        <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/"> bad website example </a></h3>
            <p>
                This website is called ARNGREN. and is a website for selling various items.
                this webiste has not implemented any CRAP designs.<br>
                I will point out all the way this website did not follow CRAP design.<br>
                First, the website features a white background and has many bright colored text.
                some of the texted is even highlighted on top of being a bright color.
                Second, the only repitition present on the webpage is that there addition of objects.
                it would appear that builders intention was to get as much content on the page as possible
                but there is not structure to the display its just all there, a true example of visual vomit.
                Even the side bar that contains brand links are in different sized and styled fonts.
                Third, there is no alignment to the objects on the screen they are just there next to eachother
                with no clear line forming along their edges.
                Fourth, the object do not have a set proximenty to each other seeing as they are all stacked ontop and
                next
                to each other. Nothing is grouped so you have to look at every item to determine if what you are looking
                for is there.
            </p>
        



        Within that section put a paragraph with a simple description of the site,
        followed by an unordered list with each of the CRAP principles,
        followed by your assessment of the site's following/not following
        of those principles in the form of a sentence or two.
