<!--
1.  Develop fully functional HTML and CSS code for a minimum of 5 pages. 
    All code should be  separate i.e. CSS and JS in separate files.
    
    menu *2pg
    company bio
    contact
    review
    account creation

2.  Entry or Home page – This page should have a layout using header, 
    main, footer,  and use ids and classes WHERE NECESSARY (and not, where not necessary). 
    The page should have actual content (text, images, videos,  etc.) including the navigation bar. 
    This page should be named index.html. 

3.  Navigation bar – All pages should have a consistent and working navigation bar. 
    The navigation bar should have links to all the pages you are going to have in your  website.
    The navigation bar should be at the same position on all the pages.  

4.  4 Other Pages – These should have the navigation bar.
    They can be Product,  Informational or Service pages or any other page you will like to have.
    You must  include the content for these pages. 
    Choose names that pertains to your website and the purpose of the page e,g“Testimonials”, “Projects”.  
    Note that the page name displayed may be slightly different from the actual file name, 
    but should be easily connected (i.e. Page page might be "About Us" or even "About CompanyName" and file name could be about.html)
    When in doubt, start by coming up with who, what, when, where, why, 
    and how to easily create starter pages (who becomes about, what could be home,
    when could be a calendar, or operating hours, or shipping times, and so on).
